# Online chess game

## Description
This project consists of building an online chess game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create an interactive 2-player chess game that works in the browser, using only local technologies — no servers are required. Players should be able to move pieces according to chess rules, restart games, and track whose turn it is.

The chess board will be generated dynamically with JavaScript, and all the logic — including legal move detection, check/checkmate logic, turn switching, and move history — must be implemented in JavaScript. The game runs completely in the browser and does not require any backend.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install required packages if necessary.

Keep in mind that the code must be written in OOP.

## Tasks
- Set up the HTML/CSS structure for an 8x8 chess board.
- Dynamically generate the board using JavaScript.
- Define chess piece classes (e.g. King, Queen, Rook, etc.).
- Implement logic for:
	Valid moves per piece
	Turn switching
	Check and checkmate detection
	Illegal move prevention
- Allow restart/reset of the game.
- Show captured pieces.
- Implement a move history panel.
- Display which player's turn it is.
- Style the board and pieces using CSS or image assets.
- Highlight legal moves when a piece is selected.
- Allow dragging and dropping pieces (drag & drop API).
- Final testing. Create README with instructions and screenshots. Submit as Git repo.

## Estimated time to work 2 weeks
